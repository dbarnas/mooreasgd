\value{
The original dataframe with the calibrated Electrical Conductivity values of CT logger data
}
\description{
This function reads in a dataframe containing electrical conductivity logs from a conductivity-temperature logger
and calculates specific conductance from in situ electrical conductivity and temperature readings.
