\description{
This function loads a raw water level file. It searches a directory for the correct logger's serial number,
plucks out the correct file or files and stacks all related files into one loaded csv.
It removes the first row of each relevant file containing logger information, then retains column headers.
Unnecessary columns are removed, and the remaining columns are renamed as needed for simplicity and consistency.
Any rows containing NA's are dropped.
