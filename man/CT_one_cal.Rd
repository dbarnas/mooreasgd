\title{Calculate temperature-compensated Specific Conductance and one-point calibration for CT logger data}
\usage{
CT_one_cal(data, date, cal.ref, Abs_pressure = 10, startCal, endCal)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{The dataframe containing raw Electrical Conductivity values}

\item{date}{Date and time column used to filter out calibration times}

\item{cal.ref}{The conductivity calibration solution specific conductance value, uS/cm at 25degC}

\item{Abs_pressure}{Absolute pressure, measured in dbar, used to calculate salinity using the PSS-78 equation.  Default = 10dbar.}

\item{startCal}{Date and time at the start of the calibration}

\item{endCal}{Date and time at the end of the calibration}
}
\value{
The original dataframe with the newly calculated Specific Conductance and calibrated SC values of CT logger data
}
\description{
This function reads in a dataframe containing electrical conductivity logs from a conductivity-temperature logger
and calculates specific conductance from in situ electrical conductivity and temperature readings.
